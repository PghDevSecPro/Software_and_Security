Course Description: This course exposes students with limited exposure to programming and
software engineering development foundational concepts to enable further understanding of the
challenges of insecure and vulnerable software. Students are exposed to basic programming
constructs (such as variables, control structures, data structures, programming syntax) as well as
the basic principles of object-oriented programming languages. The course also surveys the types
of threats and vulnerabilities inherent in software and the origins of these deficiencies. A brief
overview of secure coding concepts, principles and techniques are provided to students to
provide exposure to how software can be made more secure and resilient and how security can
be part of overall software development process.

Textbooks Optional:
• Agile Application Security: Enabling Security in a Continuous Delivery Pipeline, ISBN:
978-1491938843
• Software Security - Building Security In, Author: Gary McGraw, ISBN: 0321356705
Assignments and Grading:

Final course grade: 
10% Participation (online discussion/email/chat or participation to the live sessions)
30% Quizzes
60% Project
Participation: Students are expected to participate in class activities and discussions on virtual platform (e.g. live session or discussion board).
Quizzes: Quizzes will be administered through Canvas and will occur weekly. Students will have to complete the quiz in the classroom as in person.
There will be a timer set for each quiz lasting between 10 and 15 minutes and students will be forced to complete the quiz once starting the quiz.
Project: Project team assignments will be available via Canvas. Assignment is
due on the date specified.
Course Policies:
Late Assignment: Assignment will be accepted up to 3 days late. The maximum grade for the assignment will decrease by 10% for each day late.
Collaboration: Students are encouraged to talk with each other, the TAs, and the instructor about the course and any assignments. Any assistance, though, must be limited to discussion of the problem and sketching general approaches to a solution. Each student must write out his or her own solutions to all problems, unless otherwise stated by the instructor.

Consulting another student's or group's solution is prohibited, and submitted solutions may not be copied in any part from any source unless properly cited. These and any other form of unauthorized collaboration on assignments constitute cheating. If you have any questions about whether some activity would constitute cheating, please feel free to ask.

Academic Dishonesty: All instances of cheating or plagiarism will be dealt with according to the “CMU Policy on Cheating and Plagiarism,” which can be found at:
http://www.cmu.edu/policies/documents/Cheating.html. Policy violations will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis. Potential penalties include, but are not limited to, zero credit for the assignment and/or failure of the course.
